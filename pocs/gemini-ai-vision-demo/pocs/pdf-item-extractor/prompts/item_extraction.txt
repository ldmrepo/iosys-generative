Analyze this exam page and detect all passages and items.

## Definitions

**Passage**: Shared reference material for multiple items
- A block of content (text, table, image, or diagram) that multiple items refer to
- Typically appears above or beside the items that reference it
- Often has a header indicating which items use it (e.g., number range in brackets)
- Items cannot be answered without reading this shared content

**Item**: Individual question requiring an answer
- Has a unique sequential number identifying it
- Contains a question or task statement
- Usually includes answer choices or a space for response
- May be independent or reference a shared passage
- Each item's region starts from its number, excluding any passage above it

## Key Distinction

- Passage: "What to read" - shared context for multiple questions
- Item: "What to answer" - individual question with its own number

## Output Format
